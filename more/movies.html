                   Starting in 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has created many movies throughout the years
                   with good reviews from both critics and the general audience. Movies such as Avengers: Endgame,
                   Spider-man: Far from home, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War all had minimum reviews of 85%
                   by critics and the general audience giving a minimum of 90% except for Black Panther which was 79%. 
                   The MCU has 23 movies within the franchise and are currently developing more movies which pushes forward
                   to more success.

                    Both franchises have successful movies within the franchise. However, Marvel has proven to be more
                    successful with the majority of their movies, Additionally, Marvel has been making movies longer than the DCEU 
                    meaning they are more experienced in making movies for their franchise. With Marvel having more success over the years
                    and due to them having more experience, the MCU is better than the DCEU.

                    Starting in 2013, the DC Extended Universe has created a few good movies with most having bad 
                    reviews from the general audience and critics. Movies such as Shazam and Wonder Woman were given 
                    at least 90% by critics and the rest having reviews at 65% or below. The DCEU has only 7 movies within
                    the franchise which makes their success limited despite the development of a couple new movies.
