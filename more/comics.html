                    Ever since 1939, Marvel has published thousands of comic books loved by all fans of the franchise. 
                    Something that makes these comics interesting is their connections to real life situations. 
                    Marvel has used metaphors in their comics to give them a deeper meaning than just any
                    other superhero comic and keep readers interested. An example of this is the use of a metaphor in X-men comics. 
                    It uses mutants as a metaphor to relate to people in real life who are abnormal 
                    and shows how society treats those people.

                    Both franchises have proven to be super successful over the years with both sides have great
                    comics that have deep meanings to their stories. However, Marvel has proven to be better due to DC having
                    lots of generic stories for their more popular characters and Marvel being able to relate to certain groups of 
                    people in real life to give a deeper meaning and connection to their readers.

                    Starting in 1938, DC has published a plethora of comics books which are loved by fans of the franchise. 
                    Although a good amount of their comics are very interesting with deep meanings, there are a lot of comics
                    where main heroes of the franchise are very generic and do not have deep meanings at all. A good example is 
                    Green Lantern where the metaphor of his will-power teaches people to never give up. But heroes such as Blue Beetle
                    Martian Manhunter are said to be very generic because there is nothing to deepen the meaning of their stories.
