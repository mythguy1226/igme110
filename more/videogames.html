                    Recently Marvel has made many successful games such as Spider-man PS4,
                    Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, Marvel's Iron man VR, and Marvel Super War.
                    With a new game called Marvel's Avengers being in development, Marvel's success in the gaming
                    industry will continue to grow.

                    DC has made many great games in the past such as Batman: Arkham Asylum, 
                    Batman: Arkham City, Batman: Arkham Origins, Batman: Arkham Knight, Injustice, and Injustice 2.
                    However DC's most recent game is LEGO DC Super Villains which was released in 2018 and no new games
                    are in development. Due to the lack of new games being published, DC's success in the gaming industry will not grow.

                    With Marvel developing games at a constant pace and new games being in development, Marvel
                    has recently been more successful in the gaming industry than DC. Not only has Marvel been more successful,
                    their games are also more efficient due to Spider-man PS4 utilizing a 3d imposter system and games like Batman:
                    Arkham Knight using a 2d imposter system. Marvel's recent success and efficiency in the gaming industry and DC's lack of
                    recent success with less efficient methods is why Marvel is better with games.
